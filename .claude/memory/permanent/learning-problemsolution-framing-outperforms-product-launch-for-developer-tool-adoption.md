Reddit r/ClaudeAI post testing showed that authentic "I built this because..." problem-driven framing with personal pain point resonates better than product launch format. Focus on the problem solved, lead with concrete result (context loss between sessions), mention tool only after demonstrating value. Include honest limitations (requires Bun, optional Ollama) rather than marketing speak.
