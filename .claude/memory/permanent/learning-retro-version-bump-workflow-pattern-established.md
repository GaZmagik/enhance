Discovered efficient pattern for rapid multi-stage version bumps: (1) Create feature branch, (2) Commit to marketplace.json, (3) Push & create PR, (4) Merge with gh pr merge, (5) Cleanup branches. Executed 5 times in quick succession with consistent reliability. Could be automated further or added to plugin development checklist.
