# Reddit Post Strategy for Enhance Marketplace

## Thoughts

### 2026-01-26T23:35:47.864Z - Thought
PROBLEM/SOLUTION FRAMEWORK: The core pain points for Claude Code users are: (1) Context loss between sessions - Claude forgets everything when you start fresh, (2) Inconsistent prompt quality - users don't always phrase requests optimally, (3) No institutional memory - learnings, gotchas, and decisions aren't captured. Our plugins directly address these: memory-plugin solves #1 and #3 with persistent knowledge storage, semantic search, and gotcha injection. prompt-improver solves #2 by automatically enhancing prompts before they reach Claude.

I'll provide the strategic analysis directly:

**Differentiation vs. native Claude Code features:**
Memory-plugin and prompt-improver solve real workflow friction, but r/ClaudeAI users already have Claude Code. Frame these as "extensions that fix the gaps Claude leaves"—context loss between sessions is the killer problem. Position memory-plugin as "the notebook Claude forgot to build" rather than a nice-to-have.

**Speak to their actual frustration:**
Reddit users complain about: "I have to re-explain my project context every session", "Claude misunderstands my vague prompts", "I've learned 10 gotchas but have to relearn them". Lead with these specifics, not feature lists. "Stop re-onboarding Claude to your codebase" resonates. "Never repeat the same mistake twice" is concrete.

**Demonstrate with proof, not promises:**
One example beats abstract benefits: "Before: 5 minutes re-explaining architecture. After: Memory recalls it automatically." Show a gotcha scenario ("Avoid X because Y happened last time") where the plugin catches the mistake. Credibility wins engagement—users distrust marketing.

**Manage expectations on capability:**
Be honest about what these solve (workflow acceleration, knowledge persistence) vs. what they don't (replacing Claude's reasoning). Reddit communities detect hype immediately. "These are force multipliers for power users, not miracles" builds trust and filters for the right audience.

Why are you posting two plugins simultaneously as if they're a complete solution? Users will see this as a launch coordination—textbook marketing move. Reddit's spam detectors and moderators live for catching this.

The "problem/solution framework" is too neat. You're claiming to solve context loss, but Claude *does* remember things within sessions—what you're actually solving is *between* sessions. That's a narrower problem than you're selling it as. Users who don't do multi-session work won't care, and they'll call you out for overstating the value.

You're asking users to trust their project memory and decision history to your plugins. What happens when the memory system corrupts? What's the backup story? What if someone commits sensitive data to memory by accident? You haven't addressed the risk model, so you look either naive or reckless.

And the real killer: you're in a subreddit full of users who are *already* successful with Claude. They've got their workflows dialed in. You're not solving a problem they have—you're creating a new category of problems (learning your plugin, maintaining memory, managing another tool) and hoping the benefit outweighs it. The burden of proof is on you, and "institutional memory" sounds like enterprise software bloat to someone just trying to get their work done.

### 2026-01-26T23:40:06.398Z - Thought (model:haiku style:User-Advocate [a52d0830-d196-4e56-9d5e-5866a6a58d63])
Users on r/ClaudeAI aren't looking for plugin announcements—they're looking for solutions to their actual problems. The difference matters.

When someone posts "I keep losing context between Claude sessions", they want to know: Can I actually recover that context? How? Is it easy? They don't want to hear about a plugin's features; they want to hear "Here's how I solved this exact problem, and here's what changed for my workflow."

The strongest post would be a genuine problem-solution narrative: "I was frustrated that Claude forgot my project architecture every session, so I built this." Share the frustration first. Show the before state—messy notes, repeated explanations, lost decisions. Then show the after. That's not marketing; that's community problem-solving.

Separate the plugins in the conversation. Mention the memory plugin as the core solution to the stated problem, then note that the prompt-improver exists as a companion tool. Forcing them together reads like "buy both"—it invites cynicism. Let users discover the second plugin naturally if they find value in the first.

Include actual friction points that Reddit users will recognise: "You paste the same system prompt into three different sessions", "Claude asks the same clarifying questions each time", "You lose track of what you tried last week". Make it specific and relatable. Then show what changed. Did your workflows become faster? Did you catch bugs earlier because gotchas were injected automatically? Lead with impact, not features.

Finally, acknowledge the limitation. Plugins aren't for everyone—they require Claude Code, they take setup, they're developer-focused. Being honest about who this is for builds more credibility than pretending it solves everything for everyone. Users respect transparency.

EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE - Reddit success tips: (1) Lead with a concrete problem/insight and your result; link the tool only after giving value. (2) Be transparent about your connection and invite critique; avoid marketing language and hype. (3) Engage in comments with details (stack, tradeoffs, roadmap) instead of copy-pasting canned replies.

From a community dynamics perspective, successful developer tool posts on Reddit (especially subreddits like r/ClaudeAI or r/LocalLLaMA) share specific DNA that separates them from "shill" posts:

1.  **The "Value-in-Post" Rule:** The post must provide value *without* requiring a click-through. Don't post a teaser link. Instead, write a "How-To" guide on managing context in Claude Code, detailed enough to be useful on its own, and mention your plugins as the implementation of that method.
2.  **Technical Transparency:** Developers are cynical about "magic" wrappers. You must explain *how* it works under the hood. For the memory plugin, explicitly mention where data is stored (local vs. cloud) and the retrieval mechanism. "It stores a JSON graph in your `.claude` folder" wins trust; "It remembers everything" triggers skepticism.
3.  **The "I built this because..." Narrative:** Authenticity beats polish. Frame the post as a developer solving their own annoyance ("I got tired of pasting context, so I wrote this script") rather than a company launching a product.
4.  **Immediate Utility:** If the setup takes more than 30 seconds, you've lost them. The post should show a one-line install or a simple config snippet to prove low friction.

Minimum viable Reddit post structure: Title states the problem users face (not the plugin name). Body is a single paragraph describing what breaks without it. One code example showing the pain. Link to plugin. That's it. No 'we built' narrative, no feature list. If you feel the urge to explain the architecture, you've already lost - users don't care how it works, they care that their session state persists and their prompts get better. The post succeeds when someone reads it and thinks 'oh god yes, I need this' not 'oh, there's a plugin for that.'
